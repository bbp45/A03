- Step 3: Create a repository in your GitHub by clicking on the "+" sign to left of the profile icon and then clicking on "New repository".

- Step 10: Click on "Git" again and click on "Commit" or hit "Ctrl+K"
- Step 11: Select all the files you want to add to the GitHub and do not forget to add a "Commit Message", such as "Adding content to the README file". That way, you know what you are committing and pushing to GitHub. Then click on the "Commit" at the bottom.

- Step 21: Click on the button "Create pull request"
- Step 22: You can add a comment in the "Leave a comment," but it is not required. Then, click on the "Create pull request" one more time.
- Step 23: Wait until the orange circles turn into blue circle with a check. It means there are not any problems with the code or whatever files you are pushing to your repository.
- Step 24: Then, click on the "Merge pull request" button below and then "Confirm merge" to confirm merging. There will an option to delete the branch, but you do not have to.
- Step 25: Now, you are all set!!! It might seem like a lot of steps, but once you get into the cycle of doing this for your GitHub projects, it is a piece of cake.
